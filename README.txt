Graph Viewer Tool - Made by Nde Tsakou, Homer

Disclaimer:
Even if it is stable it might crash sometime, make sure to save your graph
regularly if you use this app.
Graphics bugs can happen but they are not harmful for the app.

Even if I believe that it will 98% of the time give the correct distance,
the distance might be wrong if your graph is very complex and happen to have 
a property that I did not think of.

The program won't work correctly for values above 2047483647 and below -2047483648

Shortcuts:
"Ctrl + z" to cancel
"Ctrl + Shift + z" or "Ctrl + y" to Redo
"Ctrl + O" to open a ".grv" file
"Ctrl + S" to save your current graph in a ".grv" file
