Graph Viewer Tool - Made by Nde Tsakou, Homer

Used C++ and Qt

You can download the GraphViewer64Bits.zip file in the repository and extract it to use the app.

Disclaimer:
I did this project in 2 weeks during summer's vacation. 
I had to stop  developing it because school started and I became too busy.

Even if it is stable it might crash on rare occasions, make sure to save your graph
regularly just in case.
Graphics bugs can happen but they are not harmful to the app.

Even if I believe that it will give the correct distance most of the time,
the distance might be wrong if your graph is very complex and happens to have 
a property that I did not think of.

The program won't work correctly for values above 2047483647 and below -2047483648

How to use:
You must create a graph first before adding nodes. Then select two nodes to connect
with the weight of your choice.

Shortcuts:
"Ctrl + z" to cancel
"Ctrl + Shift + z" or "Ctrl + y" to Redo
"Ctrl + O" to open a ".grv" file
"Ctrl + S" to save your current graph in a ".grv" file
